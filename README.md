Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process medical transcripts, extract key details,
and structure them into a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note format.
It integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER), Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis using state-of-the-art transformer models.

Features

1. Medical Transcription Processing – Extracts key medical details from doctor-patient conversations.
2.Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Identifies Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatments, and Prognosis.
3. Summarization – Converts raw transcripts into structured medical reports.
4. Sentiment Analysis – Detects patient concerns and reassurance needs.
5. SOAP Note Generation – Converts transcriptions into structured SOAP notes in JSON format.
